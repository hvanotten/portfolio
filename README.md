My Portfolio
HTML5, CSS3, React.Js Portfolio Site including links to my projects and ways to get in contact with me.

I wanted to design my own portfolio to show my proficiency in React as well as showcase my approach to accessible design adding in a basic animation or two, really show what I've learned so far.

Portfolio

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS3, React.js,

My first iteration of my portfolio was very basic and straight forward no animations everything was functional, but not super accessible. So in my second iteration making sure I built accessibility into my design from the beginning to help in the process.
Optimizations
(optional)

Lessons Learned:
I learned a great many things in this process. While I was able to do animations on a small basis it was fun getting to add some animations for my portfolio and also looking to include Reduce-motion option for my site to make it just that more accessible. Really getting to enforce some design properties I've learned along the way.

Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:

Restaurant Page - a restaurant sample page

EVOPUNK - web development



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
